Ripyl change log
================

vNext (2)
=================

  Changes
  -------
  * Added VCD file output for saving synthesized waveforms
  * Added Ethernet 10BaseT and J1850 protocols
  * Improved decode.find_logic_levels() function to be more reliable.
  * Improved CAN support with spec. accurate resynchronization

v1.2 / 2013-10-18
=================

  Changes
  -------
  * Added CAN and LIN protocols
  * Tested sucessfully with Cython 0.17. Required version has been reduced.
  * The capacify() function is numerically stable and is included in the wave_synth() function.
  * Default chunk size is increased to 10000 to improve performance
  * New generic multi-level edge finder find_multi_edges() replaces find_differential_edges().

  Bug fixes
  ---------

  * Fixed bug in Cython implementation of find_edges()
  * Fix bugs in the sigproc.py filter functions that resulted in overwriting
    chunk samples rather than properly allocating new StreamChunk objects.
  * Fix bug in find_symbol_rate() caused by including the initial state in set of edge spans.


v1.1 / 2013-9-21
================

  Changes
  -------
  * Converted sample streams from individual tuples-per-sample to use larger
    StreamChunk objects.
  * Added Cython support. The find_logic_levels() function enjoys a speed up from
    native code implementation.
  * Added infrared protocols (RC5, RC6, NEC, and SIRC).
  * Revised plotting architecture to be more general purpose.


v1.0.1 / 2013-8-20
==================

  Changes
  -------
  * Improved test suite

  Bug fixes
  ---------

  * Fix issue with decode.find_symbol_rate() that was creating bad results
  * Fix problem with bus speed detection for USB with certain packets lacking
    a second harmonic in their edge span spectra.
